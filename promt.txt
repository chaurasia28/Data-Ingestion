ðŸ¤– How AI Helped in Development
1. I leveraged AI to break down complex requirements into manageable modules, including CSV parsing, seamless integration with ClickHouse, and smooth frontend-backend communication between my Java Spring Boot backend and React frontend. This helped in organizing the development process effectively.
2. To better understand how JDBC interacts with ClickHouse and to follow best practices for handling large file uploads in Spring Boot, I used AI to research and optimize backend configuration for performance and security.
3. AI contributed significantly in enhancing the structure and readability of my React components and improving API error handling. This not only improved user experience but also boosted code maintainability and scalability.
4. During the design of the data import/export workflow, AI helped streamline the processâ€”for example, by implementing a preview-before-upload featureâ€”which was later validated by peers for its usability and user-friendliness.
5. For advanced backend functionalities like automatic table creation in ClickHouse and secure handling of large files, I consulted AI to validate the implementation against industry standards, ensuring robust error handling and security coverage for edge cases.
6. While I personally wrote the core README content, AI helped me refine the language, clarify technical descriptions, and ensure the documentation remained clear, concise, and user-friendly for developers of all skill levels.
